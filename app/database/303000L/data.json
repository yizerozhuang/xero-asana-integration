A statement has been added in ES04 (Rev E dated 10/02/2023) to include this information.\nAlthough the assessed maximum demand is 110amps per phase, considering the network constraints in that area\u00a0 sometimes, Ausgrid may decide that 100amps three phase supply may be adequate for this installation,\nSuggest you to forward the supporting information to Ausgrid for consideration\u00a0\n\u00a0\nElectrical Contractor response query below dated 2 March 2023 \u2013\nSee attached calculations from our electrician in regards to max demands calculation\nThe major discrepancy seems to be from how the ovens have been calculated.\nI\u2019ve attached the table from the Australian Standard of how this should be calculated.\nIf you take this into account with the original calculations sent through even the Engineer\u2019s max demand should be 80 Amps per phase.\nCan you please confirm you are happy for us to proceed on this basis.\n\u00a0\nRefer trailing email dated 7 March 2023 with detailed reasoning for his MD calculations\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBest Regards\n\u00a0\nSusheel Kumar Thota \nSenior Civil Engineer \u2013 Team Leader |\u00a0Neilly Davies & Partners Pty Ltd\n\nT: \u00a0\u00a0+61 2 9922 5501\nM: 0424 913 479\nA:\u00a0 Level 1 80 Mount Street North Sydney 2060\nE: \u00a0\u00a0susheel.thota@neillydavies.com.au\nW:\u00a0http://www.neillydavies.com.au/\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nThis electronic mail transmission, including any attachments, contains confidential information of Neilly Davies & Partners Pty.

Which would equate to:\u00a0 5 + (0.5 x 6)= 8amps per phase.\nSo 24amps is completely overkill. (For E.g. 24amps is equal to 552 x 10watt LED downlights)\nNext we have the Ovens, cooktops are not included in our calculations as they purely activate the igniter within the cooktop which is a neglible amount amount power.\n\u00a0\nBased on 3 or 4 units per phase, Ovens are calculated at 15amps per phase as per Table C1, (c) Column 3 of AS/NZS3000:2017\n\u00a0\nFor Example, if we had a total of 18 units (6 units per phase) we would need to refer to column 4. Which would equate to:\u00a0 2.8 x 6 = 16.8amps per phase.\nSo 38 amps per phase is clearly incorrect, this is basically a full load calculation. (9.6amps x 4 = 38.4amps)\n\n\u00a0\nThanks",
