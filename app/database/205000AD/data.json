We have also shown the path the grease arrester. This is located on P3 just north of the lift. Pump out pipe is located in the garbage room. Access is via P3 parking and then a hose will be needed to properly connect. Your pump out provider will advise once a site inspection has been completed.\n\u00a0\nPlease note that this shop front is the only one connected to the grease arrester.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\nEvan Cannan for \nSteve Biermann\nBuilding Manager\nParq on Flinders\nMob: 0466 359 375\nEmail: parq@lefand.com.au\nOffice Address: P1, 88 Keira St, Wollongong NSW 2500\nAfter Hours Emergency: 1800 LEFAND (1800 533 263)\nhttp://www.lefand.com.au/\n\n",
