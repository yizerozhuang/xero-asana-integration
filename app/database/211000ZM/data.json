(Next few years)\n\u00a0\nAs you can see from the chill water pipe work low zone the ice machines are currently only serving the Morrison pup and a little fan coil unit inside the main switch room that we can replace with a little air-cooled split unit..\n\u00a0\nTalk soon we have 500K to do something to sort this out ASAP needs to go out to tender before the end of January 2023\n\u00a0\nhttps://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.dropbox.com_sh_1572l0a0wcdjsy1_AAD2MrSByC1b-2DVtwO44nNWLQa-3Fdl-3D0&d=DwMFAg&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=EcQ6H044ajeVYxjxbxOa54VFAzMZBMi-VbiyxU4wYbk&m=jci6rn1MA7UH7UoQuOboNHSu30fPlRN7eHsAvQdzFvk&s=olucpnc86IVBY5m7eKW8DYqwwuqfbTd0snExgB1NGDY&e=\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u00a0\nARTHUR ARVANITIS | BUILDING SERVICES MANAGER\n\u00a0\nD+612 9256 3969\u00a0 M+0417 225 296 T+612 9256 3900| AARVANITIS@GROSVENORPLACESYDNEY.COM.AU\n\u00a0\n225 GEORGE STREET, SYDNEY NSW 2000\n\u00a0\nPO BOX N300 GROSVENOR PLACE, SYDNEY NSW 1220\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGROSVENORPLACESYDNEY.COM.AU",
