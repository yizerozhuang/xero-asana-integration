We are adding a mezzanine level and require:\n\u2022\tMechanical ventilation design for wet areas (bathroom, kitchen & laundry)\n\u2022\tHeating cooling.\nPlease note that the building has risers and existing services, but these would most likely need to be upgraded.\n\nI have attached the DA Approval and the PCA's requirements (check items 47 & 51) and also note requirements for fire separation of any penetrations for ducts, and condensate pipework through SOU. The design fee would also need to include certification as per the Design Regulations of Dept. of Fair Trading. \n\nLet me know if you require any further information or a site inspection.\n\nCheers,\n\nSHAHE SIMONIAN Nominated Architect  NSW ARB 7277  ZANAZAN PTY LTD ABN 67 166 540 996\nPO Box 295, Frenches Forest NSW 1640 W +612 9212 0201 M +61411 438 071 www.zanazan.studio \n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nJustin \n \nJFK Automation\nSuite 2.03, Level 2\n270 Pacific Highway\nCrows Nest NSW 2065\n \nPhone +61 2 8002 4005\nMobile +61 414 434 535\n \nWeb www.jfk.com.au",
