Please be advised that Council\u2019s Building Surveyor has reviewed the proposal and has advised:\n\nBCA Report: A review of the architectural plans revealed that the BCA Classification has changed from the Class 3 to a Class 5, therefore, a comprehensive BCA Compliance Report is required to ensure compliance with the relevant provisions of the BCA. It will be necessary to submit a BCA Compliance Report (instead of a \u201cBCA Capability Statement\u201d) to demonstrate how the proposed office fitout when completed will be able to achieve compliance or meet the performance requirements of National Construction Code Building Code of Australia Volume One 2019 Amendment 1. The report must be signed and dated by the suitably qualified consultant.\n\nA review of the BCA capability statement revealed that under most provisions of the BCA \u201cCompliance is Readily Achievable\u201d (CBA), however not enough information has not been provided to demonstrate compliance with the relevant provisions of the BCA from suitably qualified consultants.\n\u2022 Please note that the Structural design, existing fire services, mechanical, electrical, hydraulic design will be affected as a result of the proposed fitout. Please provide existing as well as proposed fire services, mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic services design documentation in support of the BCA Report for further review.\n\u2022 Please also provide the structural design and adequacy certificate for the proposed fitout in support of the BCA Report.\n\u2022 An existing and proposed fire safety schedule will also be required.\n\nPlease submit the above information within 14 days from the date of this email.\n\nSandra McCarry\nSenior Town Planner\nDEVELOPMENT ASSESSMENT.\nPlease log into the NSW Planning Portal to review the request and submit the necessary information and/or documents for your application.
