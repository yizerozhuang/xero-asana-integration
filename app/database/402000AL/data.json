Please check through, especially the gym on mezzanine as it needs outside air. *Maybe you can explain to the client that gym OA is essential, but air-conditioning is for comfort purposes that's why its done this way, and keeping budgets in mind.\n\nThanks,\nSymal\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFrom: info <info@climacool.net.au>\nDate: Tue, Feb 13, 2024 at 5:01\u202fPM\nSubject: 9 Grand Avenue\nTo: Felix YE <felixyeqing@gmail.com>\nCc: info@nswhvac.com.au <info@nswhvac.com.au>\n\n\n\n\nHi Felix \n\n\u00a0\n\nWe have a project that was recently completed at 9 Grand Avenue\n\nCamellia NSW 2142.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe building consists of a basketball stadium and offices / caf\u00e9. The main basketball courts have a fresh air system providing the courts and the customer would like to change it to a package unit set up. \n\n\u00a0\n\nCan we please organise a site visit next week to walk through the job and see what we can do reading the existing ductwork / set up \n\n\u00a0\n\nSam Ghazi\n\nManaging Director\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nP (02) 9533 6343\u00b8 M 0406 908 800\u00b8 E info@climacool.net.au\n\nA 8/40 Waterview Street Carlton, NSW 2218 Australia\n\nW climacool.net.au\n\nFacebook ClimaCoolAirSydney\u00b8 Instagram climacool_airconditioning",
