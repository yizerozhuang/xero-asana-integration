Lease plan attached. Also attached is the draft plan layout (SK02\r\nNO EQUIPMENT) - equipment is to come based on the supplier's layout. We are\r\nattempting to retain as much of the existing fitout and services as possible\r\nhowever we do need to add 3 new showers to the rear area which will require\r\nmechanical extract and hydraulic work. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSlow house is a wellness centre going into the Pacific Building, level\r\nB1/180 Campbell Parade, Bondi Beach NSW 2026. The tenancy is currently\r\nSpeedo Fitness Club. It currently has a 23m pool, treatment rooms, bathrooms\r\nand gym equipment. We plan to break the pool up into 3 smaller pools - a\r\nlarger spa, a cold plunge and a salt pool. We are adding off the shelf\r\ninfrared saunas with new showers, treatment rooms, a communal traditional\r\nsauna and steam room. Again where possible we are going to retain the\r\nexisting services however we will need to re-rout ductwork and add extract\r\nfrom showers and potentially the traditional sauna? \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe want to have these drawings for our CDC in the first week of Feb. Can you\r\nprovide a fee proposal for these 2 projects. Do you need any additional\r\ninformation to provide this quote? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nAnne\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nAnne Warren\r\n\r\nStudio Coordinator\r\nGiant Design Consultants\r\n\r\n\r\nStudio 302/59 Great Buckingham Street, Redfern, NSW 2016\r\nEmail:  <mailto:annew@giantdesign.com> annew@giantdesign.com \r\nTel: (02) 8045 2950\r\nWeb:  <http://www.giantdesign.com> giantdesign.com\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTeam Giant will be taking a well deserved break over the holiday season.
