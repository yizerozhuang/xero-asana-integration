Anthony @ Sydney <Anthony.Mano@cbre.com>\nSubject: Price for MEP design at Ingleside\n\u00a0\nHi Mark,\n\u00a0\nHope your well.\n\u00a0\nAre you able to provide a proposal on MEP design for a 2200sqm fit out that we are currently quoting by COB Friday. The space is a conference centre and I\u2019ve added plans that we currently have, we are only looking at making changes to the meeting space are and not the kitchen side, we estimate this to be around 1000sqm.\n\u00a0\nThe scope will be\n\u00a0\n\n    Redesign full A/C for around 2200sqm- full replacement has been requested at this stage.\n    Redesign of power in conference rooms, lights will be as is just upgraded.\n    Fire aspects associated with any changes to wall placement.\n    No Hydraulics at this stage.\n\u00a0\nOn a separate part of the project we are looking at connecting additional stormwater pipes that run into the local creek, they currently only have guttering that runs onto vegetations that causes the area to be very damp and they are having issues with mould in the building. Is this something that you are able to design as well?\n\u00a0\nLet me know your thoughts, design works will start in the next few weeks.\n\u00a0\nThanks,\nAdrian Hawes\nSenior Project Manager\nCBRE | GWS Local | Principal Projects\nLevel 21, 363 George Street | Sydney, NSW 2000\nM +61 490 420 949\nadrian.hawes@cbre.com",
